# Interpreting-Unsupervised-Learning-Models

1. Firstly, I checked the distribution of the adverse effect. This was done by displaying the count of adverse effects (num_effects) within both the Drug and Placebo groups.
   
2. Next, I carried a Two-sample x proportion test to Assess whether there is a statistically significant difference in adverse effects among the treatment groups to ascertain whether the pharmaceutical drug has led to significant side effects.
   
3. I performed a Chi test of Independence to determine if the number of adverse effects is independent of the groups.
 
4. Moving on, I created a histogram to show age distribution.
  
5. And lastly, to determine the significant difference between the ages of both groups, I performed a two-sided independent-samples t-test and a Mann-Whitney U test
